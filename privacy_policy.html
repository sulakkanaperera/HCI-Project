                <p> We store your contact, billing and shipping details [but not payment card details] in our online system for as
                    long as you have an account with us. Your details will also be saved on past invoices in our offline invoicing
                    system for up to 6 years or as long as deemed necessary for UK/EU tax compliance. <br>

                    a period of up to 2 years [unless deemed necessary as part of on going projects], before permanent deletion.
