            <h5> New Rover Car</h5>
            <img src=history/9.jpg>
            <p>The introduction of a new Rover car is always an event of considerable interest:
                perhaps because It occurs less frequently than in most other manufacturers _ The recent
                announcement of the new Rover 2000 has even greater significance than ever because
                not only is the car entirely new: having no parts common to other Rover Models, but it
                spearheads Rover 's re-entry mto the lighter car field: and a new factory has been built
                and equipped specially to produce It.
                Possibly the most advanced feature ofthls car is the method of body constmction_ The
                body panels of the Rover 2000 are assembled around a base unit on to which all the
                chassis components: electrical equipment and ancillaries are first mounted. At this
                stage the vehicle is m skeleton form but mechanically complete. It is driven and tested.
                The individual panels: doors and roof are then attached to the stmcture as separate
                items.</p>

            <h2>Are they hard to work on?</h2>
            <p>Well, they are not always easy. The engines are 
                generally pretty straightforward and the electrics
                 are your standard Lucas fayre, but the De Dion rear
                  suspension and inboard rear brake set up is considered
                   to be an absolute nightmare for mechanics not used to 
                   it – just setting up the rear brakes can result in 
                   swear words you never knew existed.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-8">
            <h2> History in the making from The Rover News October</h2>
            <h5>In the beginning there was an idea, a project, then came a design and finally in 1963 The Rover launched Rover 2000 or as we know is Rover P6. This extract
                is  taken from Rover News of October 1963 and is reproduced courtesy of British Motor Industry Heritage Trust.
            </h5>
            <img src=history/1.jpg>
            <p>All base units and body panels are carefully aligned and then jig drilled: allowing no
                possible variation in the location of attachment pomts_ Consequently replacement of
                any panel damaged through accident IS quick precise and perfectly straightforward.
                The base unit constmction of the Rover 2000 combines light weight and great strength.
                The box section steel bulkhead between the engine and passenger compartments IS
                particularly robust and it is this rigid section that takes through coil sprmgs: the
                stresses and reactions of the Independent front suspension units.
                A shon remote control gear lever fits the hand naturally and encourages full use of the
                car's four speed: all synchromesh gearbox.Power for the new Rover 2000 comes from
                an entirely new four cylinder engine of simple, robust, Single overhead camshaft
                layout. An excellent power output of 90 bhp_ (installed) is developed at rpm_ and
                this is combmed With extreme economy of operation. At a steady SO m.p.h. the Rover
                2000 retums figures of 36 miles per gallon. The overhead camshaft design also gives
                the engine a wide range of speeds up to a maximum of 6,000 rpm_ Cruising m the
                upper nineties IS easily obtained. The front suspension IS mdependent the coil
                sprmgs mounted horizontally All the ball joints are sealed against entry of dust and
                Rear suspension is of the de Dion type sliding tube: specially developed by Rover
                engineers for the 2000_ It shares v„-ith the beam axle the advantage that the rear Ivheels
                always remam parallel: but not the disadvantage of excessive unsprung weight. It also
                possesses the smooth and stable ride of independent rear suspension without the
                disadvantage of wheel misalignment and consequent heavy tyre scmb_
                To give effective stopping power: Dunlop disc brakes are fitted front and rear: mounted
                inboard at the rear. Servo assistance IS provided for easy pedal operation.
                The 2000 has been designed to nun on radial-ply tyres belted constmctlon. They
                give higher cornermg power: good speed capacity at one pressure setting and Increased
                mileage.</p>

            <h2>1963 Rover P6</h2>
            <h5>Is it what you think it is…?</h5>
            <img src=history/2.jpg>
            <p>In planning the driving compartment of the 2000: Rover designers have combined the
                practical with the aesthetic. The facia is finished in African Walnut gram and
                instruments are grouped in a smgle rectangular panel: clearly visible through the two-
                spoke steermg wheeL All switches are placed m a row on the facia rail. They are
                recognisable by symbol: name: shape and movement. A wide: readily accessible shelf
                is suitable for gloves: lady's handbag or any other item that requires a convenient
                resting place. Controls for the highly efficient heatmg system are centrally located and
                easily operated. Extra fresh air vents are set into the rail in front of the driver and
                passenger with an adjustable flap to direct cool air to any desired level and a control to
                regulate the quantity of air entering the car.
                The Rover 2000 offers a high degree of comfort. At the rear: passengers sit in two
                well-formed individual seats designed specifically to ensure exceptional comfort and
                lateral support for fast tourmg. Side arm-rests on the doors and a folding centre arm-
                rest complete the easy-chair effect. When the centre arm-rest is folded up a padded
                portion between the seats affords accommodation for an occasional third person.
                Front seats are also particularly designed for high-speed comfort and effective lateral
                support durmg the rapid cornering of which the car is capable. There is ample fore and
                aft adjustment for drivers of every stature: while the back-rests can be adjusted to and
                locked in any position from the vertical to the fully reclming_The steermg wheel may
                be adjusted for rake to enable the driver to adopt the position that suits him best. The
                practical boot has a capacity of 161/4 cubic feet which gives room for a great many
                pieces of luggage.</p>
