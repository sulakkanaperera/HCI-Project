						<p>Winning the Car of the Year award isn’t necessarily any guide to how good a car really is – you only have to look at some of the past winners to see that. But the vehicle that took home the
						1964 gong was thoroughly deserving of it, because it was a forward-thinking model that was safe, comfortable and great to drive. It was the Rover P6 – a car that was a revelation thanks to its 
						clean-sheet design and thoroughly modern mechanicals. It set a new standard when it came to refinement, performance and handling – and even now the P6 is fabulous to drive, especially in V8 form.
						Launched at the 1963 Earls Court motor show, the P6 replaced the staid P4 that had earned Rover its ‘Auntie’ nickname. The car was aimed at the young executive who wanted modern, sporting, high 
						quality transport, and it was unofficially known as the P6 because it was Rover’s sixth post-war model. There were many reasons for the P6’s ultra-modern image, not least of all its 
						clean lines, unconventional construction, racing-derived rear suspension design and all-round disc brakes – those at the rear being in-board to reduce unsprung weight. The front 
						suspension was even designed so that a gas turbine engine could have been fitted – what a car that would have made! Instead the powerplants remained conventional, with the original
						1978cc engine being bored out to 2204cc, but not until after the fabulous Buick-derived 3528cc V8 had joined the party in 1968.Next year marks the 30th anniversary of the final P6 being built, 
						and as with so many classics, it’s ridiculously underpriced. While the 3500 derivatives are the most sought after, it’s perfectly possible to use a four-cylinder P6 as an everyday 
						car as they’re safe, reasonably economical and comfortable as well as good to drive. Buy yours soon before word gets out!</p>

						<p>        The construction of the P6 is quite unlike most other classics that you’re likely to have worked on. The nearest
        comparison is the Citroen DS, as it also featured a monocoque onto which the unstressed panels were hung. With
        all the
        panels being bolted on (including even the roof), it’s easy enough to remove everything and view the stressed
        ‘skeleton’
        in its naked state – although this isn’t something you can ask to do as part of your pre-purchase inspections!
        That’s a
        shame, because the monocoque can rot, especially in the centre section – although the P6 is far less rust-prone
        than
        most of its contemporaries. It’s essential that you have a good prod underneath with a bradawl, because even
        fairly
        major corrosion can easily be masked by the factory-applied underseal.The sills also need careful inspection;
        they’re
        crucial to the car’s strength but also rot-prone. Don’t be fooled by outer sill panels that are in perfect
        condition;
        these are bolt-on items that are purely cosmetic rather than structural. It’s also important to check the
        condition of
        the sills from inside the car; peel back the carpets and have a good poke.Your next port of call is the area
        under the
        back seat, so remove it and make sure the metal at either side is still there; it often isn’t. If there’s
        corrosion here
        there’s a good chance that the rear wheelarches are rotten, along with the closing panel that the back door
        shuts onto.
        You’ll need to inspect the wheelarch lips as well as the rear quarter panels because these are some of the most
        common
        corrosion hot spots. It’s a similar story for the leading edge of the rear wings; if these have corroded badly
        there’s a
        very good chance that the inner wings will also be full of holes. Even if the wings appear to be okay, have a
        good look
        at the rear valance as well as the rear quarter panels; these are quite happy to rot for England. Open the boot
        lid and
        see what state the boot floor is in; also see what the panels inside the rear wings are like. The rear
        suspension
        trailing arms are bolted to these, which means they’re under a lot of stress. Consequently, once the metal has
        started
        to weaken through rust it’s possible for the arms to pull right out.Less serious, but highly likely, is rot in
        the front
        wings around the wheelarches and along their trailing edge (just ahead of each front door). While you’re
        inspecting
        these, take a look at the undersides of each door; these are more prime targets for the tin worm. It’s just the
        same for
        the front valance, which could well be just a memory by now.The bonnet and boot lid won’t have corroded, as
        they’re made
        of aluminium. However, because of this the paint may have started to flake off around the washer jets,
        potentially
        spreading further afield within the panel. The very last cars were sprayed in the new paint shop set up to
        finish the
        SD1, but whereas cars sprayed in the previous plant generally had a decent finish, the paint tended to just fall
        off
        these last cars. By now they should all have been attended to though; any paint that hasn’t fallen off yet is
        unlikely</p>

						<p>There were two engines fitted to the P6; an overhead cam four-cylinder unit and that classic pushrod V8. The
        four-pot
        initially displaced 1978cc, but this rose to 2205cc when the 2200 models replaced the 2000 in 1973. Whichever
        four-pot
        was fitted, there was the option of one carburettor or two – and any of these units should happily despatch
        100,000
        miles before major maintenance is required. Despite the inherent durability of the four-cylinder unit, there are
        still
        potential problems to look out for. One of the most common is water leaking from the block’s side cover plates,
        potentially leading to overheating. Things can be made worse if these plates have rotted through, but used
        plates are
        available for £30-40 each. Things aren’t helped by cylinder heads that can corrode internally if the correct
        anti-freeze
        levels haven’t been maintained: a 50:50 mix is best. Listen for a rattling timing chain; it’s normal for some
        clattering
        at start up, but this should quickly subside. Even when warm there’ll be a hollow ringing sound at around
        1200rpm, which
        then disappears as revs rise; the top chain is straightforward to replace, the bottom one far less so. If a
        TC-badged
        car seems to have rather flat performance, it could be that the carburettors are out of balance, but it’s an
        easy enough
        job to sort this out. Also, cars with twin carbs are prone to running on and pinking thanks to the rather high
        10:1
        compression ratio. Where SC engines are concerned, be prepared for wear of the throttle spindles and linkage. If
        there’s
        an annoying rattle at high engine speeds it’s likely to be a cracked carburettor heat shield; replacements are
        £10. If
        you can hear rattling from inside the inlet manifold, it’s the spacer inside the carb-to-manifold adaptor. It
        can get
        into the engine so it’s a good idea to retrieve it!On SC and V8 engines you need to check the exhaust manifold
        mounting
        flanges, as these crack; used manifolds are typically £35-50 apiece. The V8 engine is equally durable as long as
        it’s
        properly serviced. That means oil changes every 3000 miles; if this hasn’t been done there’s a good chance the
        hydraulic
        tappets will have got clogged up and the camshaft, followers and rocker shaft may have worn prematurely too. The
        giveaway is an especially noisy top end; these units should run very quietly even as the revs rise. Don’t be too
        concerned by an oil pressure gauge that seems to read lower than you’d expect, as these engines run quite
        happily with
        just 15-20psi showing. Of more concern is knocking from the bottom end; this signals that a rebuild is due, for
        which
        you can expect to pay £500 for the parts.Chief wear point on the V8 is tappet number eight, which is the first
        to get
        noisy due to the small oilways. It’s caused by infrequent oil changes, which should be performed every 3000
        miles.
        Tappet wear is normally an indication of camshaft wear, but fixing it all is straightforward.Oil leaks from
        pre-1973 V8s
        are par for the course, as they used rope-type seals for the front and rear bearings. These are ineffective, and
        replacing them means stripping down the engine. New neoprene front seals are £12 each but upgrading the rear one
        means
        machining the block.As well as renewing the oil regularly, it’s essential that the coolant is replaced every
        couple of
        years. Being an all-alloy unit, the V8 is prone to internal corrosion if anti-freeze levels are allowed to drop
        off, so
        check the temperature gauge once the car has been allowed to idle for a few minutes. If it gets ever hotter,
        it’s
        probably because the radiator and block are full of deposits that need to be flushed out.</p>

				<div class="safetyContent" id="scams">
					<div class="safety-content">
						<p>Whether there’s a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic gearbox fitted, there shouldn’t be any
        significant
        problems – except perhaps where the 3500S is concerned. This was fitted with an uprated version of the manual
        ‘box
        fitted to the four-cylinder cars, and it’s not really up to the job of coping with the V8’s torque. Look out for
        difficult gear selection and jumping out of gear which indicate there’s a £400 bill looming for a rebuilt ‘box.
        The
        SD1’s five-speed unit can be fitted – but they’re now getting very hard to find. Automatic cars were initially
        fitted
        with a Borg Warner Type 35 gearbox, but from 1974 the Type 65 unit took over on the 3500. This later gearbox is
        smoother
        than the earlier unit, but slightly less durable. Whichever unit is fitted, check the state of the transmission
        fluid
        (the dipstick is to the left of the engine, near the oil dipstick on BW35 equipped cars, to the right on BW65
        models).
        It should be pink and without any horrific smells attached; if it’s got black specks in it and smells really
        grim, the
        gearbox will need a rebuild before long because it’s overheated at some point.The rest of the transmission is
        conventional, so you need to make sure there are no clonks as you take up the drive. If there are any, it’s
        because at
        least one of the six universal joints in the propshaft or driveshafts has worn out. Replacements are £8.50 each
        for the
        propshaft and £19 for the driveshafts; renewing them is easy.Gear selection problems and rattly gearsticks on
        manual
        cars are usually due to wear in the remote linkage. Pre-1971 cars, with a tortuous linkage, are especially
        prone. New
        bushings are available, but fitting them means removing the engine and gearbox. Differentials are long-lived as
        long as
        they’re not allowed to run dry. The problem is that they’re prone to leaks, which means there’s a very real
        chance of
        seizure. The earliest cars (up to 1967) are even more badly affected because they were fitted with faulty
        breathers
        which allowed the casing to pressurise, blowing the seals out – although any such affected units should have
        been
        replaced by now.</p>

								<div class="safetyContent" id="steering">

						<p>The P6’s worm and roller steering box is precise and predictable when set up well, but not as sharp as a
        rack-and-pinion
        set-up. Make sure there are no tight spots, indicating that someone has overtightened the box to take out any
        play. The
        steering can be heavy, which is why power assistance is desirable. It can be retro-fitted without too much
        difficulty;
        expect to pay £300 to convert a V8 and £400 for a four-cylinder car.The front suspension design is equally
        unusual, in
        that there are horizontal coil springs which are actuated by bell-crank levers, which transmit their loadings
        into the
        bulkhead. Despite its eccentricity, the system is effective and durable. One potential fault is worn ball joints
        at the
        bottom of the suspension legs; once they’re in need of replacement there’ll be an obvious clonk on uneven
        surfaces.The
        rear suspension features a coil-sprung De Dion axle, and it’s important that you check the rubber gaiter on the
        de Dion
        tube. If this is split it will allow dirt in and the grease out. Once this has been allowed to happen there’s a
        very
        real danger of the sliding joint seizing up; you’ll know this has happened by the effect it has on the handling!</p>

											<div class="safetyContent" id="wheels">
					<div class="safety-content">
						<p> Some Series I 2000TCs were fitted with wire wheels, but you’re unlikely to find a car that’s still got them.
        They’re not
        strong enough for a V8, and as with any car on wires, you need to check that the splines which locate the wheels
        haven’t
        worn. Also check that all the spokes are in good condition; they can rust or work loose, causing havoc if
        several give
        way.The all-disc brake system works brilliantly – if set up properly. But with the discs at the back being
        in-board it’s
        a nightmare gaining access to everything – which is why the rear brakes are often neglected. The handbrake often
        won’t
        hold the car while the rear calipers leak fluid – but very gradually so it’s not especially obvious, although
        MGBD Parts
        & Services provide service-exchange calipers that are machined and sleeved with stainless steel. Things will be
        made
        worse if the back axle has leaked oil all over the discs, so get underneath and check the condition of
        everything very
        closely.Cars built before 1966 were fitted with a Dunlop braking system, while the later P6 featured a Girling
        set-up.
        Parts for the early cars are now very hard to find, which is why many owners have converted to the later type;
        early
        cars to original spec are very rare accordingly. It’s fine if the work has already been done, but if you feel
        like
        embarking on the project yourself, bear in mind that you’ll need the front suspension legs from a later car as
        well as
        the complete final drive assembly. </p>

										<div class="safetyContent" id="trim">
					<div class="safety-content">
						<p>There were various colours and materials offered throughout the life of the P6; all are now obsolete and even
        decent used parts are now hard to find. Leather trim for cars built between 1971 and 1973 is prone to shrinking
        and tearing, so check it’s not falling apart.Used exterior trim is easy enough to track down, although you’re
        unlikely to find any new items. Bumpers rust as they’re chromed steel, but they can be rechromed at around
        £220.00 (MGBD Parts)</p>
